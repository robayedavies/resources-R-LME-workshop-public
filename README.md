# resources-R-LME-workshop-public

Notes, resources for workshops on using R and linear mixed-effects models.

There will be four sessions:
1. LMEs -- why when and how?
2. Random effects -- specifying more complex models
3. GLMMs
4. Reporting standards

I've associated the workshop sessions with *.R scripts* with example code for doing the analysis steps I'll talk about, *.csv data files* for running the analysis steps on, and *.pdf files* holding the slides.

You can download everything in a zipped folder by clicking on the green "clone or download" button on the top right hand side of the repository window box.

Note that you will see several files with the following names:
R-LME-why-when-and-how
R-random-effects-structures
R-GLMM
R-reporting-standards

There will be:
* .Rnw files -- these are Sweave (Latex) files I used to write the slides
* .pdf files -- the slides (Latex generates slides as pdf. files) -- open in pdf reader
* .R -- analysis code files -- you open in R (from inside R-studio)
* .csv -- data files you can open in excel

Note that I wrote a long version (R-LME-why-when-and-how.R) and a short version of the R code file for the first session: R-LME-why-when-and-how-short.R
* The difference is that the long version has all the code I used to generate the plots I use in the slides for presentation.
* The short version has just the code necessary to run the models I talk about.

You can open the .Rnw files in R-studio but don't bother, it is the raw latex code I used to write the slides and only of interest if you want to use the code to write your own slides i.e. if you use latex.

The slides pdfs had to be corrected to fix some image size issues, so you just need the files called:
-revised.pdf

Note that I have taken some images from published work with acknowledgement but not permission. This is temporary, for the sake of illustrating key points, and the images will be replaced or removed at the earliest opportunity.
