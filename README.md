Notes, resources for workshops on using R and linear mixed-effects models:

1. .Rnw (Sweave) files, .pdf outputs for slides on 
-- why, when and how of LMes
-- specifying more complex models varying in fixed and random effects
-- generalized linear mixed-effects models

2. .csv data and .R code files for demonstration

Note that I have taken some images from published work with acknowledgement but not permission. This is temporary, for the sake of illustrating key points, and the images will be replaced or removed at the earliest opportunity.
