Snijders and Bosker (2012) present a helpful overview of multilevel modelling. 

Baayen et al. (2008; see, also, Barr et al., 2013; Judd et al., 2012) discuss mixed-effects models with crossed random effects. A very useful recent paper by Bates and colleagues (Bates et al., 2015) offers an enlightening and useful perspective on model fitting by key figures in the development of thinking about mixed-effects models in Psychology.

Many developmental researchers will record categorical outcome variables, like the accuracy of responses. Generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) can be used to analyse categorical outcomes, and Jaeger (2008; see, also, Bolker et al., 2009) provides a clear motivation for using GLMMs, given hierarchically structured data, rather than traditional methods like ANOVA.

Some very recent papers offer useful discussions of and how-to guides for the calculation of R^2 measures for mixed-effects models (Johnson, 2014; Nakagawa & Schielzeth, 2013).

Researchers will be concerned to estimate power for potential study designs. This can be done appropriately for studies, for which mixed-effects models shall be used, by simulation (Johnson, 2015).
